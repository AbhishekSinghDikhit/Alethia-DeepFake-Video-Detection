 Alethia Lab is a DeepFake video detection system which helps verify media authenticity and counter online disinformation. It uses deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze video content for pixel inconsistencies, motion artifacts, and facial distortions. The system improves the detection accuracy through a hybrid methodology, by recognizing the subtle manipulation patterns that are introduced by GAN-based DeepFake models. Alethia Lab provides real-time verification via an intuitive front-end interface, with an easily accessible API for individuals, law enforcement, and media organizations. Its purpose is to uphold digital integrity by mitigating identity theft risks, disinformation, and fraud based on DeepFake.
